Dave Hacker's photographs of familiar London landmarks are taken on an old film camera giving them the grainy romance of nineteenth century daguerreotypes and allowing contemporary architecture to take on a magical, historicised patina. The view of London's City Hall could almost have been snapped by the ghost of Henry Fox Talbot, while a seemingly antique portrait of the Palace of Westminster is confirmed as a modern image only by the struts and spars of the London Eye encroaching in the foreground. By combining digital and film photography, Hacker strives to put back the magic seen in antique photography that he feels is lost by the use of modern cameras. Fingerprints and dust are formed on the ground glass of the lens to create an accidental unique stamp and dark shadows are cast around the edges of the frame as Hacker makes it clear that the nostalgic aspect of these works is not merely about London's architectural past, but also the adventurous early years of photography. Bid now to take home this innovative yet elegant set of three photographs each 73 x 73cm.
